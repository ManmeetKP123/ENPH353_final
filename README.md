# Autonomous Parking Violation Detector
This repo was for our final project for ENPH 353. The goal was to program a self-driving car to collect the parking IDs of parked vehicles. We did this using PID and a convolutional neural network (CNN). 
##### Note: This repo does not contain all the files and folders used in the competition as our instructor re-uses them every year and would like for them to be private.

## File Structure

We created all the folders including the optional ones to make the file structure cleaner. We can further discuss and show the final file structure and how nodes are connected to each other upon request. 


## General Strategy
### Driving
- Use HSV thresholding for road detection and finding the centroid of the road
- Use PID for driving and controlling the robotâ€™s motion around the outer and inner loop 
- Detect movement and the presence of a pedestrian through HSV thresholding and the change in pixels in subsequent frames

### License Plate Detection
- Extract license plates from parked cars through HSV thresholding, contour detection, and perspective transform 
- Read license plates from extracted images using a CNN

### CNN Model Training
- Generate data points (license plates) and apply Gaussian blur before training to better represent simulation conditions 
- Gather data points from the simulation 
- Improve model accuracy by narrowing down the characters the model struggled with within simulation and feeding the model more data points that include the determined characters
